# PayFlow | Fintech Payment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes payment transaction data
from a fictional fintech platform called PayFlow.

The goal is to explore payment performance,
identify patterns in failed transactions,
and translate analytical findings into
business recommendations.

## Business Problem

PayFlow wants to understand:

- How successful are payment attempts?
- Which payment methods have higher failure rates?
- What are the most common failure reasons?
- How does transaction volume differ
  across payment methods and categories?
- Which areas should be investigated further?

## Dataset

The dataset contains 1,200 synthetic payment
transactions from January to June 2026.

Each row represents one payment attempt.

The dataset includes transaction dates,
payment methods, transaction amounts,
transaction statuses, customer segments,
merchant categories, and failure reasons.

The data was created for educational purposes.

## Tools

- Microsoft Excel
- PostgreSQL / SQLiteOnline
- Google Sheets
- Looker Studio
- GitHub

## Business Questions

1. How many transactions are recorded?
2. How are transactions distributed by status?
3. What is the average successful transaction amount?
4. Which payment method has the highest
   successful transaction volume?
5. What are the most common failure reasons?
6. Which customer segment has the highest
   average transaction amount?
7. How does successful transaction volume
   differ by merchant category?
8. Which city generates the highest
   successful transaction volume?

## Analysis Process

### 1. Data Exploration

Explored the dataset using Excel to understand
its structure, identify missing values,
and define key performance metrics.

### 2. SQL Analysis

Used SQL to answer business questions through
filtering, aggregation, grouping, and sorting.

### 3. Data Visualization

Created a Looker Studio dashboard to visualize
transaction performance and category comparisons.

### 4. Business Interpretation

Translated analytical results into findings,
insights, and recommendations.

## Key Insights

### Payment Method Performance

Bank Transfer recorded a failure rate of 10.78%,
the highest among the available payment methods.

### Failure Reason Distribution

Insufficient Funds accounted for 38.71%
of failed transactions.

### Merchant Category Performance

Travel generated higher successful transaction
volume, while Grocery had more successful
transactions.

## Recommendations

- Investigate Bank Transfer failure reasons.
- Review customer-facing payment error messages.
- Evaluate transaction count and volume together.
- Monitor payment performance over time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of
transforming raw payment data into
business insights.

By combining data exploration, SQL analysis,
dashboard development, and storytelling,
the analysis identifies areas for further
investigation and potential improvement.
